# E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description
The goal of this project is to to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code.  I configured a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.
## Install
Download the file from my github!

## Usage
```md
When you add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
Then you are able to connect to a database using Sequelize
When you enter schema and seed commands
Then a development database is created and is seeded with test data
When you enter the command to invoke the application
Then your server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
When you open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
Then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
When you test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
Then you are able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```
